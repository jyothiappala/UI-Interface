<p><b><h1>Become a Life Member & Help Us in Saving Lives</h1></b><br>MOHAN Foundation has helped save over 5000 lives through organ and tissue donations. It has helped give momentum to organ donation programme through advocacy, capacity building, conducting workshops and counselling and supporting organ donation families.
All our services are rendered free. We are guided by the Transplantation of Human Organs Act, 1994, where no organ can be bought or sold. Hence, we do not pay anything to the organ donor family or do not receive any monetary benefit from the recipients. We survive purely on the philanthropy of the community.
15:10 11-01-2020Recognizing the important work that we have undertaken, we have received support from philanthropically minded individuals, corporate donors, and trusts. We have a 50% tax exemption status under Section 80G and a 100% tax exemption status under Section 35AC of Income Tax Act, 1961. We are approved recipients of foreign contributions under the Foreign Contribution Regulation (FCRA) Act, 1976.
